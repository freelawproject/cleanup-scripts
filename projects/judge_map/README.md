Judge Maps
---

This is an experiment to begin processing the data 
being extracted from judicial disclosures

I took the first ~600 reimbursements and mapped the locations
to Latitude and Longitude.

Using the following block to plug in our data you can review 
the global reimbursements of judges by loading the spinning_globe.html
